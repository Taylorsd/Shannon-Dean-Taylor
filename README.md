                        This was my final project in Dreamweaver Web Design Course at Rose State College. 
              Dreamweaver responsive starter was used as the base. The pages was created throughout the 
              semester and the lessons learned in class were applied to this personal web project. 
                
                        I have seperated the Div's <!--  --> so each section can be seen better. Pay close 
              attention to the  <div class="btn-group-vertical", i have put the circular wheel navigation menu
              inside the <div class="dropdown-menu">. The icons on the wheel are linked to my sites and are the 
              same links that corrospond with the matching button navs.
